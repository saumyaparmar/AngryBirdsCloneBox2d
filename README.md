# üê¶ Angry Birds Clone ‚Äì Built with Box2D üê¶


This is a clone of the Angry Birds game, built using the Box2D 2.3.2 physics engine and developed in C++. The project replicates the core gameplay mechanics and physics behavior of the original game as closely as possible. It was created as part of an independent study project for my graduate program.

The game runs on a custom 2D engine developed by my professor, which provides support for sprite rendering, debug wireframe drawing, and camera functionality. Sound integration is handled using irrKlang. 
The game is designed for a resolution of 1280x720; fullscreen mode is not supported due to input positioning issues. Debug Mode in the game, depicts how the physics bodies really look and how they react to each other.

# ü§ì PHYSICS OF ANGRY BIRDS ü§ì
This section covers the key physics components used in the game, such as bird abilities, particle effects, and the role of the Box2D library in driving the simulation.

Before exploring the specific physics mechanics of Angry Birds, it‚Äôs important to first grasp the fundamentals of the Box2D physics engine.

## (a) Box2D 
This project uses **Box2D 2.32**, a 2D physics engine written in C++ by Erin Catto. Newer versions of Box2D are written in C, which can also be explored if preferred. Box2D provides realistic simulation of rigid body dynamics, gravity, collisions, forces, friction, restitution (bounciness), and joints‚Äîkey for replicating Angry Birds' gameplay.

### Box2D World

All physics interactions occur within a single Box2D world that handles gravity, collisions, and object behaviors. The physics update runs at a fixed timestep of 16.6 ms (60 FPS) for smooth and consistent simulation.

#### World Settings

- **Gravity:** Set to -10.0f along the Y-axis to simulate real-world gravity.
- **Scale:** 50 pixels = 1 meter (Box2D uses meters). This scaling ensures consistent physics behavior relative to the game's visuals.

Physics calculations drive the position and rotation of game objects, updated every frame in the game loop.

### Box2D Simulation Steps

Each frame, the physics update follows this sequence:

1. **Time Step:** Usually 1/60 seconds for 60 FPS.
2. **World Step:** Advances the physics simulation (`World::getWorld()->Step()`), handling collisions and movement.
3. **Update Objects:** Retrieves each body's position and angle to update corresponding game objects.
4. **Iterate Bodies:** Loops through all physics bodies to ensure accurate state updates.

### Creating Physics Bodies

A physics body represents an object affected by forces and collisions. To create one, define:

1. **Body Definition (`b2BodyDef`):** Sets initial position, rotation, and type:
   - *Static:* Immovable (e.g., walls).
   - *Dynamic:* Movable, affected by physics (e.g., birds, pigs).
   - *Kinematic:* Moved manually, unaffected by forces (e.g., moving platforms).

2. **Shape Definition:** Defines the collision boundaries with shapes like:
   - `b2PolygonShape`
   - `b2CircleShape`
   - `b2EdgeShape`

3. **Fixture:** Attaches a shape to a body and defines properties such as:
   - Density (mass)
   - Friction (surface sliding)
   - Restitution (bounciness)

4. **Position & Rotation:** Set initially in meters and radians via the body definition.

Here is a basic example of creating a physics body for a rectangular block matching the sprite size:

For detailed Box2D documentation, see [Box2D official docs](https://box2d.org/doc_version_2_4/).


## (b) Collisions in Box2D

In Box2D, collisions are central to simulating realistic interactions between objects. When two physics bodies (like birds and blocks) come into contact, Box2D calculates forces and responses based on their physical properties.

### üîë Key Concepts 

1. **Collision Shapes**  
   Each body is attached to a shape (circle, polygon, edge, etc.) which defines its collision boundary.

2. **Fixtures**  
   Fixtures connect shapes to bodies and define physical properties such as:
   - **Density** ‚Äì Affects mass
   - **Friction** ‚Äì Affects sliding resistance
   - **Restitution** ‚Äì Affects bounciness

3. **Collision Detection**  
- Box2D first filters out objects that are too far apart to collide. Then, for objects that are close enough, it performs precise checks to find exact contact points and calculate collision details needed for realistic interactions.

4. **Collision Callbacks**  
   Custom collision responses are handled through:
   - `BeginContact()`: Called when contact starts
   - `EndContact()`: When contact ends
   - `PreSolve()`: Allows modifying contact before it resolves
   - `PostSolve()`: Used to analyze the results (like impulses)

---

### üß© Custom Collision Handling

In this project, I‚Äôve implemented a custom collision system using a class `AngryBirdsContactListener`, derived from `b2ContactListener`. It allows me to define custom behaviors when specific objects interact (e.g., birds hitting blocks or pigs).

To handle specific outcomes depending on object types, I‚Äôve used the **Visitor Pattern**. This enables defining different behavior depending on both objects in a collision ‚Äî for example, a Blue Bird colliding with a Glass Block vs. a Stone Block.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Collision Processing

To make the physics in this game feel real and responsive, every object that takes part in a collision ‚Äî whether it's a bird, a block, or a pig ‚Äî needs a few things:
- A **physics body** (which can be either static or dynamic)
- A **health value**
- A **material type**, like wood, glass, or stone if a block

When two objects collide, Box2D handles the physics and gives us detailed information about what happened during the impact. This info is what I use to figure out how much damage each object should take.

---

### üìä Using Impulse to Calculate Damage

One of the most important things Box2D gives us during a collision is the **normal impulse** ‚Äî basically, how hard two objects hit each other.

We also get:
- **Tangential impulse**, which tells us how much sliding happened
- **Contact points**, which show exactly where the objects touched

But it‚Äôs the **normal impulse** that really matters when it comes to applying damage. The harder the hit, the bigger the impulse ‚Äî and the more damage we apply.

---

### üü¶ Example: Blue Bird Hits a Block

Let‚Äôs walk through a common scenario: a **Blue Bird** hits a **block**. Different block types take damage differently:
- **Glass** breaks easily, so it has a **high damage multiplier**
- **Wood** is average
- **Stone** is tough, so it needs a strong hit to crack

When the Blue Bird hits the block, we check:
1. What kind of block it is
2. How strong the collision was
3. Whether that hit was hard enough to cause damage

This makes every bird‚Äìblock interaction feel unique and satisfying.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works Under the Hood

Here‚Äôs the basic flow:

1. **Get Collision Info**
   - I grab data from Box2D (using the `b2WorldManifold`) to understand where and how the collision happened.

2. **Check the Block‚Äôs Type**
   - Based on whether it's made of **wood, glass, or stone**, I apply a different damage threshold and multiplier.

3. **Apply Damage**
   - If the collision impulse is big enough:
     - I calculate how much damage to apply.
     - If that damage is greater than the block‚Äôs remaining health, I reduce its life or destroy it.
     - For fragile materials like glass, even small impacts can be devastating.

---

### üíª Sample Code: Bird‚ÄìBlock Collision Handling

### üéØ Why This Matters

This system makes the game feel more realistic and fun. Instead of every block behaving the same way, the **material type** and **impact strength** really affect the outcome. A bird might bounce off a stone wall, but completely shatter a glass one.


## (c) Birds

In this project, I‚Äôve included **six different birds**, each with their own unique ability. But before I jump into their individual powers, I want to explain how the **slingshot** works‚Äîsince every bird‚Äôs flight starts from there.

### üèπ How the Slingshot Works

1. I store the **starting position** of the slingshot.
2. When the player drags the bird, I calculate the vector between the current bird position and the slingshot‚Äôs starting point.
3. I **normalize** this vector (to get just the direction).
4. Then, I multiply it by the bird‚Äôs **individual speed multiplier** to control how fast that bird launches.
Why use a multiplier? Because birds differ in size and weight. Even though the distance pulled is the same for every bird, the resulting speed needs to vary to reflect their physics correctly. The multiplier makes sure the launch feels balanced for each bird.

Here‚Äôs a sample code for the force applied when bird is launched:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a4c202f-5a7d-479f-a46e-aad9d4e0c599)

### Birds Overview
Every bird in the game needs to be defined with a few key physical properties: its **shape**, **speed**, and **size**. These factors directly influence how much **force** the bird applies when it collides with other objects like blocks or pigs.

I use Box2D to set up the physics body for each bird with the following components:

- A **dynamic body** ‚Äì so the bird responds to forces like gravity and collisions.
- A **b2CircleShape** ‚Äì representing the bird‚Äôs circular collision boundary.
- **Density** ‚Äì which affects the bird's mass.
- **Friction** ‚Äì determining how much it slides along surfaces.
- **Restitution** ‚Äì controlling how bouncy the bird is on impact.

Together, these elements make sure each bird behaves differently based on its physical profile‚Äîgiving a sense of weight, momentum, and realism during gameplay.

Here is a sample code for setting up the physics body of any bird:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/702206b5-40d5-4459-ab53-4bd1b26db5f0)


#### üü• (1) Red Bird

The Red Bird is the simplest of all‚Äîit doesn't have any special abilities. You just launch it and let physics do the rest.
Here are the physics properties used:

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `10.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `100.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)

#### Demo:
![RedBirdGif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed4ed8c-aeb8-4092-bad3-6368da22e20e)

#### üíõ (2) Yellow Bird
The Yellow Bird is built for speed. It has a moderate density and friction, but what sets it apart is its dash ability. When activated mid-air, it quickly accelerates forward, making it perfect for smashing through wood. Its default speed is already high, and the dash gives it an extra velocity boost.

Here are the physics properties used (_These values are arbitrary, applied based on what gives a better feel, based on rigorous testing_):

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `12.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `270.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)

#### Special Ability:
For special ability of this bird, I apply an addtional linear impulse.

Sample Code for Special Ability:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96ecd763-40b0-4454-b0ac-9a4e25efcbc6)

#### Demo:
![YellowBirdGif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe19cdfc-1ca8-4f2a-a1db-1b4cc0ac539a)

#### üîµ (3) Blue Bird  
The Blue Bird is small and lightweight, with lower density and a smaller radius. Its unique ability allows it to split into three smaller birds mid-air when the special action is triggered. This makes it ideal for taking down fragile structures like glass by spreading impact across multiple points.
I add a damage multiplier when collided with a glass object, as explained in [Collisions in Box2D](#b-collisions-in-box2d)

Here are the physics properties used (_These values are arbitrary, applied based on what gives a better feel, based on rigorous testing_):

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `5.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `35.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)

#### Special Ability:
Here's how it works:
- I spawn **two additional Blue Birds**, one slightly above and one slightly below the original.
- All three birds are given the **same linear velocity**, so they continue flying in the same forward direction.
- To achieve the spread effect, I apply a **linear impulse** to the two new birds in **opposite vertical directions**‚Äîone upwards and one downwards.
- I also flag each new bird with `isSpecialAbilityDone = true` to ensure the special action doesn‚Äôt trigger again.
- Their state is set to `LAUNCHED`, and a debug color is assigned to help distinguish them visually during testing.

Sample code for Special Ability:

#### üí£ (4) Black Bird
The Black Bird is all about power. Slower but heavier, it causes massive damage on impact. Its special ability triggers an explosion, perfect for destroying strong materials like stone.

Here are the physics properties used (_These values are arbitrary, applied based on what gives a better feel, based on rigorous testing_):

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `5.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `120.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)
  
#### Special Ability:
Here‚Äôs how the Black Bird‚Äôs ability works:

- When activated, it spawns a **bomb particle emitter** (details covered in the particle section).
- Over **100 small explosive particles** are released with force, damaging everything in their path (visualize in the DEMO).
- Special Ability, can be activated on command or when it collided the bird changes color and in the end explodes.

This makes the Black Bird perfect for clearing out dense, reinforced structures.

#### DEMO:
![BlackBirdGif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c7fafd-a276-4bbc-bbfd-4d6e0980e9d6)



#### ‚ö™ (5) White Bird
The White Bird is designed to attack from above by dropping an explosive egg directly below its flight path. When the special ability is triggered, it releases the egg mid-air and then changes color to indicate the ability has been used. 

Here are the physics properties used (_These values are arbitrary, applied based on what gives a better feel, based on rigorous testing_):

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `5.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `210.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)
  
#### Special Ability:
Here‚Äôs how the White Bird‚Äôs ability works:

- On activation, the White Bird spawns an **egg** directly beneath it.
- The bird receives a rapid **upward impulse**, making it fly.
- The egg behaves like a black bird: when it **collides**, it **explodes**.
- Over **100 explosive particles** are generated, scattering with force and dealing area damage to nearby objects (visualized in the DEMO).

Sample Code for White Bird Special Ability:

#### üü¢ (6) Green Bird
The Green Bird is unique for its boomerang-like behavior. Unlike other birds, it doesn't just fly straight‚Äîit can reverse direction mid-air. This allows it to curve back toward targets, especially useful for hitting hard-to-reach places from behind.

Here are the physics properties used (_These values are arbitrary, applied based on what gives a better feel, based on rigorous testing_):

- **Body Type:** `b2_dynamicBody` (affected by gravity and forces)
- **Shape:** `b2CircleShape` centered on the sprite
- **Radius:** Matches the visual size of the bird, converted from pixels to meters
- **Density:** `5.0f` (affects mass)
- **Friction:** `0.3f` (surface interaction)
- **Restitution:** `0.3f` (controls bounciness)
- **Initial Speed Multiplier:** `150.0f` (used to calculate launch velocity from slingshot)
  
#### Special Ability:
Here‚Äôs how the Green Bird‚Äôs ability works:

- On activation, the Green Bird will start moving like a boomerang.
- A **force vector** `(-35.0f, -8.0f)` is applied, scaled by the bird‚Äôs mass, creating a sudden shift in direction, making it go in opposite direction of it movement.
- At the same time, the bird‚Äôs angle is **manually rotated** backward by `0.15 radians` to enhance the turning effect.
