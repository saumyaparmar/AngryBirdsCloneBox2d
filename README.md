# 🐦 Angry Birds Clone – Built with Box2D 🐦


This is a clone of the Angry Birds game, built using the Box2D 2.3.2 physics engine and developed in C++. The project replicates the core gameplay mechanics and physics behavior of the original game as closely as possible. It was created as part of an independent study project for my graduate program.

The game runs on a custom 2D engine developed by my professor, which provides support for sprite rendering, debug wireframe drawing, and camera functionality. Sound integration is handled using irrKlang. 
The game is designed for a resolution of 1280x720; fullscreen mode is not supported due to input positioning issues.

## 🎮 Game Highlights 🎮
1. 🐦 **Birds with Unique Abilities**  
   Each bird has a special ability (e.g., acceleration, splitting, explosion, etc.).

2. 🐷 **Animated Birds and Pigs**  
   Smooth animations for flight, impact, and destruction to enhance visual feedback.

3. 🧱 **Manifold Collision Shapes**  
   Structures, pigs, and birds use different shapes for realistic collisions and interactions.

4. 💨 **Smoke & Particle Effects**  
   Visual effects like explosions, debris, and smoke trails for added polish.

5. 🎥 **Dynamic Camera**  
   Follows the bird in flight and zooms in/out to keep the action in view.

6. 🔊 **Sound Integration**  
   Background music and sound effects for launches, collisions, destruction, and bird abilities (powered by irrKlang).
